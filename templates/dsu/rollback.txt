if you want to rollback to the preivous state of dsu
then dont use path compression, then change will happen only after a union operation

change : 
par[xx] = yy
sz[yy] += sz[xx]
therefore after each operation
store in an array this xx
therefore to rollback to previous sate
and we know yy from par[xx], therefore sz[yy] -= sz[xx]
we ill set par[xx] = xx
