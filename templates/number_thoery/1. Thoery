1. consider equation ax + by = c, where a, b, c belong to Z
2. The integer solutions of this equation only exist's when c is divisible by gcd(a, b)
3. Steps to find solutions

- first we find any roots to the equations ax + by = g where g = gcd(a, b)
- these roots can be caldculated by some recursive code
- now to calculate any roots for the equation ax + by = c, we multiply those roots by c / g
- let those roots be x0, and y0
- if you consdier any general solution of these equations to be x, y then x it can be represented of the form
  x = xo + u
  y = yo + v

  and when you put these values in ax + by = c, we get
  au + bv = 0
  therefore u = -bv/a
  if v has to be integer then v should be divisible by whatever is the denominator obtained by reducing b / a to it's standard form
  and the standard form of p / q is (p / gcd(p, q)) / (q / gcd(p, q))

  therefore v can be represented as k * a / g 
  and therefore u can be represented as k * b / g

  therefore the general solutions of the equations ax + by = c are
  x = x0 + u = x0 + kb/g
  y = y0 = v = y0 - ka/g

  where k can be any integer value in the entire Z plane

4. Also in recursive code we find solutions for positve a, b and if a < 0 we multiply x0 by -1, and if b < 0 then we multiply y0 by -1
